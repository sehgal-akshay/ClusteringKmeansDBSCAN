# ClusteringKmeansDBSCAN
Pattern Recognition helps in solving problems by finding the patterns among incoherent data and make it more coherent. The problem I am analyzing in this report is that of clustering. Clustering gives a very specific and meaningful information about the dataset and lets us draw meaningful conclusions. The prime focus is on K-Means clustering but I have also analyzed DBSCAN clustering to draw comparison between the two and analyzed the failed performance of K-Means. I have also analyzed K-Means for different value of ‘k’ and analyze the Elbow technique to find the optimal value of k for best results.
